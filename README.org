* pinky - Monitoring system built on Openresty


** Purpose:

** TODO How to build plugins:

*** Pinky rest structure
**** "/pinky/" Core plugins.

**** "/pinkyc/" - Custom plugins
     Custom modules are loaded here.
     There is no requirement for nginx.conf additions as a catchall
     for pinky.dispatch() is handled via /pinkyc/*

***** Every custom module require a preamble containing the following.
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
module("rvm", package.seeall)
local p = require 'pinky'
local json = require 'cjson'
#+END_SRC

      This covers pulling in pinky core as well as json for output
      formatting.

#+BEGIN_SRC lua

local RVM_PATH = "/usr/local/.rvm/"
#+END_SRC
